## Instructions
* Download all the codes above including the pth files
* Run the ppo_rb.py file to see the performance of the agent after 12 hours of training

## Desription of Files
* model.py - Actor-Critic Method (Neural Network Implementation)
* multiprocessing_env.py - Create parallel environment to speed up the training process of the RL agent
* preprocessing.py - Apply preprocessing to the game environment to optimize the training process
* ppo_rb.py - The main file to perform the training. The current file setting is set to testing.
